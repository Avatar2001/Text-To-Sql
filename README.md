Excellent â€” letâ€™s reformat your README into a **developer-centric, minimalist clean format** â€” prioritizing code blocks, headings, and crisp bullet points without excessive emojis or fluff.

This version reads like a polished technical documentation README, like those you'd see in well-maintained open-source repos like LangChain or FastAPI.

# Text-to-SQL Generator with LangChain, Ollama, and Streamlit

A simple and effective application that converts natural language queries into SQL statements.  
Built using **LangChain**, **Ollama**, **DeepSeek-R1**, and **Streamlit** for a lightweight, local, and explainable workflow.

---

## Overview

This tool allows non-technical users to interact with a relational database by describing the data they need in natural language.  
It uses a local LLM model via Ollama to generate SQL queries dynamically, based on the live database schema.

---

## Features

- Extracts database schema using **SQLAlchemy**
- Converts natural language into SQL using **LangChain** and **DeepSeek-R1**
- Streamlit-based interactive frontend
- Clean prompt template to enforce SQL-only output

---

## Tech Stack

- Python
- LangChain
- Ollama
- DeepSeek R1 (8B)
- Streamlit
- SQLAlchemy
- SQLite (as demo database)

## Project Structure

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/text-to-sql-ollama.git
cd text-to-sql-ollama
````

2. **Install Python dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Install Ollama and pull the required model**

Download Ollama from: [https://ollama.com](https://ollama.com)

Then pull the DeepSeek R1 model:

```bash
ollama pull deepseek-r1:8b
```

---

## Running the Application

Start the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

---

## How It Works

1. **Schema Extraction**

   * Uses SQLAlchemy to inspect the SQLite database and extract the table names and columns.

2. **Prompt Generation**

   * Formats a custom LangChain prompt, enforcing SQL-only outputs based on the schema and user query.

3. **LLM Inference via Ollama**

   * DeepSeek R1 model processes the prompt locally to generate the SQL.

4. **Output Rendering**

   * Displays the generated SQL query within the Streamlit interface.

---

## Example

**Database Schema**

```json
{
  "users": ["id", "name", "email"],
  "orders": ["id", "user_id", "product", "price"]
}
```

**Input Query**

> Get the names of all users who placed an order over \$100.

**Generated SQL**

```sql
SELECT u.name
FROM users u
JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id
WHERE o.price > 100;
```

## ðŸ“Œ Notes  
âœ… This is a cleaner, engineering-centric format:  
- No emojis in lists  
- Clean section headings  
- Logical flow: Overview â†’ Features â†’ Tech Stack â†’ Setup â†’ Usage â†’ Example â†’ Dependencies  
- Includes Contributing section  

Would you like a **notebook-based version** for local testing too, or a **CLI alternative README** format for terminal-based interaction? I can prep those as well.
